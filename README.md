# Free-Riding in Multi-Issue Decisions

These is the source code for the numerical experiments in the paper "Free-Riding in Multi-Issue Decisions" (full version). 

The code is in the directory `multi-issue-elections`. After installing requirements (`requirements.txt`), run `python freeriding.py` to create the data files (`*.pickle`), then run `python plot.py` to create all plots. It is possible to run `python freeriding.py` several times on the same machine to allow for parallelization. 

The directories
`delta_satisfaction`, `designated-freeriders`, `different_num_cand`, `different_num_issues`, `different_num_voters`, and `different_rules` contain additional plots.
